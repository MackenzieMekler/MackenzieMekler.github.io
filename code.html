                <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
                <p>In this project I used R to analyze data on cell size, shape, etc. I was then
                    able to use these graphs and Python in order to write a machine learning model
                    that could reliably differentiate between cancerous cells and regular cells.
                    This project was made to familiarize myself with machine learning as well as to
                    practice data analysis skills in research

                <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
                <p>In this project I used R to analyze data from the observations of the spiny mice 
                    for a publication. Some of the gathered data was published while others were not. 
                    In this project I included the code measuring the datasets as well as some of the 
                    created graphs. However, I have censored some important information such as file 
                    names and paths and I have not included the datasets. The lab from the paper can be 
                    contacted for raw data.

                <h2>The Magic Mirror Project</h2>
                <p>This project was inspired by the Magic Mirror build on github. In this project I made
                    a very similar thing but using PyGame from Python rather than electron.js like in the original 
                    project. The purpose of this project was to take on a larger python project and practice using 
                    APIs, PyGame, and displaying data.
